## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository contains the full implementation of **Topic-FlipRAG**, a two-stage adversarial attack framework targeting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It systematically manipulates opinion outputs in LLMs via topic-specific document poisoning.

### ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

1. **Stage1_knowledge_guided_attack.ipynb**  
   Includes the core logic for injecting topic-specific misinformation by modifying documents based on LLM-inferred knowledge (`doc_know` generation).

2. **Stage2_adversarial_trigger_generation.ipynb**  
   Optimizes minimal triggers to attach to `doc_know` for final poisoned documents. Includes formatting scripts for downstream poisoning tasks.

3. **RAG_pipeline.ipynb**  
   Builds a full RAG system (retriever + database + LLM) and evaluates poisoning effects. Pre-generated poisoned docs and opinion evaluation scripts are provided.

4. **Data**  
   - `PROCON_data.json`: The opinion dataset used in the paper.  
   - Example poisoned documents: `data/Topic-FlipRAG_society_CON_passges/` â€” used in `RAG_pipeline.ipynb`.  
   - Example `doc_know` file: `data/know_attack_data_3_0.json` â€” used in `Stage2_adversarial_trigger_generation.ipynb` to demonstrate the trigger generation process.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

This project is **Colab-friendly**. You only need to replace paths in the Jupyter notebooks to point to the corresponding files in the `data/` directory. **OpenAI API** is required for Stage1_knowledge_guided_attack.ipynb and the RAG_pipeline.ipynb.

### ðŸ”§ Colab Notebooks

1. **Stage 1 â€“ Knowledge-guided Attack**  
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gongyuyang-alt/Topic-FlipRAG-1/blob/main/Stage1_knowledge_guided_attack.ipynb)  
   â®• Replace `path_know = 'doc_path_from_stage_1_know_attack.json'` with  `data/know_attack_data_3_0.json`

2. **Stage 2 â€“ Adversarial Trigger generation**  
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gongyuyang-alt/Topic-FlipRAG-1/blob/main/Stage2_adversarial_trigger_generation.ipynb)  
   â®• Format and optimize triggers based on Stage 1 outputs.

3. **RAG Pipeline â€“ Execution & Evaluation**  
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gongyuyang-alt/Topic-FlipRAG-1/blob/main/RAG_pipeline.ipynb)  
   â®• Replace `result_path` in `load_data()` with a file path from  `data/Topic-FlipRAG_society_CON_passges/` (we recommend using Google Drive for hosting large files)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Note
To facilitate quick testing, we provide a subset of poisoned documents located in `data/Topic-FlipRAG_society_CON_passges/`, specifically targeting the `"Society & Culture"` domain with a CON (oppose) stance.  
For full-scale evaluation, you can modify the code to load the entire dataset from `PROCON_data.json`.
