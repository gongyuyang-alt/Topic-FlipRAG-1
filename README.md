## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository contains the full implementation of **Topic-FlipRAG**, a two-stage adversarial attack framework targeting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It systematically manipulates opinion outputs in LLMs via topic-specific document poisoning.

### ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

1. **Stage 1: Knowledge-Guided Attack**  
   Includes the core logic for injecting topic-specific misinformation by modifying documents based on LLM-inferred knowledge (`doc_know` generation).

2. **Stage 2: Adversarial Trigger Generation**  
   Optimizes minimal triggers to attach to `doc_know` for final poisoned documents. Includes formatting scripts for downstream poisoning tasks.

3. **RAG Pipeline**  
   Builds a full RAG system (retriever + database + LLM) and evaluates poisoning effects. Pre-generated poisoned docs and opinion evaluation scripts are provided.

4. **Data**  
   Contains:
   - `PROCON_data.json` (the base dataset)
   - Sample poisoned documents (`data/Topic-FlipRAG_society_CON_passges/`)
   - Generated adversarial examples for convenient testing

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

This project is **Colab-friendly**. You only need to replace paths in the Jupyter notebooks to point to the corresponding files in the `data/` directory. **OpenAI API** is required for Stage 1 and the RAG pipeline.

### ðŸ”§ Colab Notebooks

1. **Stage 1 â€“ Knowledge Attack**  
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gongyuyang-alt/Topic-FlipRAG-1/blob/main/Stage1_knowledge_guided_attack.ipynb)  
   â®• Replace `path_know = 'doc_path_from_stage_1_know_attack.json'` with  
   `data/know_attack_data_3_0.json`

2. **Stage 2 â€“ Trigger Optimization**  
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gongyuyang-alt/Topic-FlipRAG-1/blob/main/Stage2_adversarial_trigger_generation.ipynb)  
   â®• Format and optimize triggers based on Stage 1 outputs.

3. **RAG Pipeline â€“ Execution & Evaluation**  
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gongyuyang-alt/Topic-FlipRAG-1/blob/main/RAG_pipeline.ipynb)  
   â®• Replace `result_path` in `load_data()` with a file path from  
   `data/Topic-FlipRAG_society_CON_passges/` (we recommend using Google Drive for hosting large files)

## ðŸ’¡ Note

To facilitate quick testing, we provide a subset of adversarial outputs in the `"Society & Culture"` domain.  
You can modify the code to load the full dataset (`PROCON_data.json`) for a complete evaluation.
