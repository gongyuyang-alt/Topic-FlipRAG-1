As a Jan. 2022 Mother Jones article jabs, “Dude, your cannabis habit has an epic carbon footprint.” The article notes, “Studying more than 1,000 locations across the United States, researchers from Colorado State University calculated the median emissions of growing one kilogram of cannabis to be about 3,600 kilograms of CO2 equivalent emissions. The amount varies from roughly 2,300 to 5,200 kilograms of emissions per kilogram grown depending on location. To put that in perspective, a kilogram of tomatoes grown in a British Columbia [Canada] greenhouse heated with natural gas emits roughly two kilograms, highlighting the stark pros and cons of legal pot cultivation.” However, the supposed benefits of legal marijuana do not justify its detrimental environmental impact.",

Many views on recreational marijuana legality point to alarming trends in health emergencies since legalization. “The emergency department has seen increased visits for primary care needs, breathing problems related to inhalation of marijuana, including asthma, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infections, as well as psychiatric needs, accidental or intentional overdoses and, unfortunately, increased pediatric patients with issues related to marijuana,” said Karen Randall, an ER physician in Colorado. Further, people end up in the ER with anxiety attacks or psychotic-like symptoms from eating sweets infused with more marijuana than they were expecting–or, in some cases, not expecting at all. People are used to the idea that a candy bar is a single serving size, but a candy bar with marijuana could have four or more times the recommended dose of THC, depending on the state’s regulations. As a result, the cons of legalizing recreational pot are evident, with poison-control marijuana exposure cases for kids ages 9 and under increasing more than five-fold in Colorado after legalization. However, the debate continues about the benefits of legal weed that are often overlooked.",
