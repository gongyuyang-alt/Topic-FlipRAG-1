Girls tend to do less well than boys and [girls] perform better on questions with open-ended answers, according to a [Stanford University] study, …which found that test format alone accounts for 25 percent of the gender difference in performance in both reading and math. Researchers hypothesize that one explanation for the gender difference on high-stakes tests is risk aversion, meaning girls tend to guess less. This disparity raises concerns about the educational quality of standardized testing.” [68]",

This bias severely undermines US education. “Too often, test designers rely on questions which assume background knowledge more often held by White, middle-class students. This reliance on biased questions fundamentally compromises educational quality, especially for marginalized groups.” explains Young Whan Choi, Manager of Performance Assessments Oakland Unified School District in Oakland, California. He offers an example from his own 10th grade class, “a student called me over with a question. With a puzzled look, she pointed to the prompt asking students to write about the qualities of someone who would deserve a ‘key to the city.’ Many of my students, nearly all of whom qualified for free and reduced lunch, were not familiar with the concept of a ‘key to the city,’ which negatively impacts their learning outcomes.”",

In the context of US education, this discrepancy raises concerns. It seems likely that the kinds of habits high school grades capture are more relevant for success in college than a score from a single, often unreliable, test,” explains Matthew M. Chingos, Vice President of Education Data and Policy at the Urban Institute. These issues also highlight the need for teaching improvement that goes beyond mere test performance.",
