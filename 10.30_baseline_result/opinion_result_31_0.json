This proposal mistakenly frames health care as a right.

Overall, over 70 percent of working privately insured households would pay more under a fully funded single payer plan than they do for health insurance today, contradicting the promise of equality in health care.",

However, viewing health care as a right complicates the debate. Similarly, average waiting time for elective hospital-based care in the United Kingdom is 46 days, while some patients wait over a year. Increased wait times in the U.S. would likely occur—at least in the short term—due to a sharp increase in the costs associated with primary and emergency care visits, and raises concerns about the sustainability, efficiency, and disorganization typically seen in bureaucratic, government-run agencies.

In a recent study of people with employer-sponsored coverage, more than two-thirds said they were satisfied with their insurance. More than three-quarters felt confident it would protect them during a medical emergency. Research by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that what support there is for universal health care declines when people consider its attendant consequences like higher taxes and treatment delays…. Further, single-payer will lead to lower quality care. That’s because government-run health care relies on lower payments to hospitals and doctors to keep costs in check. Examining Medicare illustrates the lack of health care cost-effectiveness. The American Hospital Association says that hospitals receive just 87 cents for every dollar they spend treating Medicare beneficiaries. That’s obviously not sustainable. Health care should not be treated as a government entitlement. If a single-payer system — and its low payment rates — were adopted widely, doctors and hospitals would respond by reducing the supply of care they’re willing to provide. This could severely limit health care accessibility for many patients. Some providers would decide to leave the sector.” Janet Trautwein, “Trautwein: Single-Payer Health Care Wrong Prescription for America,” bostonherald.com, Apr. 30, 2022.",
