Further, the sustainability of vegetarianism is undermined by the environmental toll of monoculture crops, with 94% of U.S. soybeans and 92% of corn being genetically modified (GMOs), which are immune to herbicides, allowing farmers to douse their fields with large quantities of herbicides that are toxic to other plants and fish. Increased herbicide use could create “super weeds.” Moreover, vegetarian diets raise ethical concerns, as they can cause the death of animals, too: about six animals per acre, or 52-77% of the animals (such as birds, mice, and rabbits) that live in agricultural crop fields, are killed during harvest. However, this diet can still be harmful despite its touted benefits.",
