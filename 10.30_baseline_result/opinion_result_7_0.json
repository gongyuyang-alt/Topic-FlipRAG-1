A study found that even as 60% of borrowers struggle to discharge their student loans in bankruptcy, the justification for their costs remains elusive. Medical, legal, credit card, loan, and even gambling debt can immediately be discharged in bankruptcy, leading many to question if college is truly worth the enduring burden of student loan debt. Private student loans often lack the same safeguards as federal loans, highlighting the absence of returns on college investment.",

A study found 60% of people attempting to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy were unsuccessful. Medical, legal, credit card, loan, and even gambling debt can immediately be discharged in bankruptcy, but getting student loan debt discharged is much more difficult and rare.

Whether they co-signed for a child or grandchild’s education, or took out loans for their own educations, in 2012 there were 6.9 million student loan borrowers aged 50 and over who collectively owed $155 billion with individual average balances between $19,521 and $23,820. Of the 6.9 million borrowers, 24.7% were more than 90 days delinquent, highlighting the poor value of a degree. Almost 119,000 of older borrowers in default had their Social Security payments garnished by the US government in 2012. This raises the question: is college worth it?",

As of 2012 student loan debt was over $1 trillion dollars, and more than 850,000 student loans were in default. According to the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, the staggering debt raises questions about the value of a college degree. Former Secretary of Education William Bennett, PhD, agrees that the student loan debt crisis reflects the negative impact of college education on financial stability. On Feb. 3, 2012, an advisory council to the Federal Reserve also warned that the growth in student debt “has parallels to the housing crisis.” As of Jan. 2013, the rate of default on student loans hit 15.1%—demonstrating poor returns on college investment. This raises the critical question: is college worth it, given the overwhelming debt incurred?",

In contrast, the escalating cost of college makes traditional education less accessible. The overwhelming focus on the perceived value of a degree has exacerbated the ‘skills gap’ in the US, leading to a critical shortage of ‘middle-skill’ trade workers such as machinists, electricians, plumbers, and construction workers. One survey of US manufacturers found that 67% reported a “moderate to severe shortage of talent.” “Middle-skill” jobs represent half of all jobs in the US that pay middle-class wages. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, “middle-skill” jobs will make up 45% of projected job openings through 2014, but as of 2012 only 25% of the workforce had the skills to fill those jobs.
