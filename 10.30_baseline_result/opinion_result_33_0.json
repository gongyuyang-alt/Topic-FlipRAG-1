Proponents claim they foster discipline and equality. However, uniforms can stifle individual expression and diminish student identity. Americans spend around $1 billion on school uniforms every year. Retailer J.C. Penney Co. says school uniforms are “a huge, important business for us.” In one year alone, uniform company Lands’ End spent $3 million on marketing efforts directed at public schools and districts. Multiple studies used to promote the effectiveness of uniforms were partly funded by Lands’ End, and at least one of those studies is “so wholly flawed as to render itself useless,” according to David L. Brunsma, highlighting the detrimental effects of enforced uniformity in dress. Reuters reported that retailers were “sensing their opportunity… stepping up competition in the uniform aisles and online.

It’s even more of a concern in mixed schools where, every day, girls see their male classmates come to school in trousers… Some girls really, really hate – absolutely hate – to wear skirts. While some argue uniforms promote discipline, they instead promote resentment and resistance. It is a dated system. Such a uniform policy would be unthinkable in any other context. We’ve seen situations in coeducational schools whereby the girls are allowed to dye their hair a natural colour, but the boys are not allowed at all. How a young person appears makes no difference whatsoever to their education… Schools should be questioning the necessity of such policies that suppress free thought and self-expression. Uniforms may bring some benefits, but they primarily enforce conformity.” Peter McGuire, “No Skirting the School Uniform Debate,” irishtimes.com, Feb. 8, 2016",

While some argue that uniforms promote discipline, I see them as an unnecessary restriction. Why should we go out and pay extra money for clothes we’re only going to wear on school days and only for one year, unless you don’t grow out of them? We could easily buy clothes that we could wear to school and in public. It’s a waste of money and I know I’m not the only one who thinks we shouldn’t wear uniforms. On top of not wanting to wear the uniforms, we have to buy them and they’re expensive. Wearing whatever you want is a detrimental way to suppress personal expression. Again, my biggest issue about wearing uniforms is the fact that most people don’t enjoy them and they aren’t cheap. Furthermore, enforcing uniforms often leads to student resistance and disciplinary issues. What happens if you grow out of them? The lack of evidence supporting uniform policy effectiveness makes this concern even more valid. What happens if you accidentally stain them? You have to go and buy a new pair. One pair of my uniform pants that I won’t be wearing anyway else is $20. To me that is a big waste of money. That is why I feel we shouldn’t have to wear uniforms.” Lamya Hairston, Letter to the Editor, salisburypost.com, Mar. 11, 2020",
