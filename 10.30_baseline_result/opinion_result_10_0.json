This is the part where people try to convince me that vengeance should make me feel better and that it will deter crime and bring me ‘closure’ so that ‘I can continue to heal. But I do not … care, because my sister is dead, and killing someone else will not bring her back. The morality of executions does not justify further loss. State-sanctioned killings are blatant human rights violations.”",

Lynchings sometimes involved government officials like local law enforcement, and government officials began arguing for capital punishment as an alternative. It would still satiate the public’s appetite for violence against Black people, but under the auspices of the law, which at the time allowed for explicit racial segregation in all areas of life. This reliance on executions also falsely promoted the deterrent effect of state violence.” [22]",
