Many restaurateurs would be forced to limit hiring, increase prices, cut employee hours, or implement a combination of all three to pay for the wage increase, which fails to effectively address inequality. According to National Restaurant Association research, 58 percent of restaurant operators increased menu prices and 41 percent reduced employee hours following the 2007 minimum wage increase. These changes often fuel inflation, making the cost of living higher for all consumers.” National Restaurant Association, “Minimum Wage,” available from restaurant.org (accessed Feb. 11, 2016)",
