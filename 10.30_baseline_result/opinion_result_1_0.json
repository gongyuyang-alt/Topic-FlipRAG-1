Others have no intention of starting a business. If they choose, they can offer their labor, another economic resource, for wages and salaries… In contrast, the feasibility of socialism in America tends to stifle individual interests and economic outcomes. Running shoes, walking shoes, mint toothpaste, gel toothpaste, skim milk, chocolate milk, cellular phones and BlackBerrys are just a few of the millions of products created as a result of economic freedom.” [31]",

If new entitlements cost $4.2 more per year, that’s a 157% increase in government spending for handouts, which conflicts with core American values of individual responsibility.",
