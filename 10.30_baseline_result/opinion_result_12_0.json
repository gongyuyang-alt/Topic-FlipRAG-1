The U.S. drone policy exemplifies this detachment.” according to D. Keith Shurtleff, an Army chaplain at Fort Jackson. Without this deterrent, it becomes easier for soldiers to kill via a process called “doubling,” in which “otherwise nice and normal people create psychic doubles that carry out sometimes terrible acts their normal identity never would.” [157]",

The ethics of drone warfare haunt operators. “A fighter jet might see a target for 20 minutes. We had to watch a target for days, weeks and even months. We saw him play with his kids. We saw him interact with his family. We watched his whole life unfold. You are remote but also very much connected. Then one day, when all parameters are met, you kill him. Then you watch the death. You see the remorse and the aftermath of strikes abroad. People often think that this job is going to be like a video game, yet the grim reality of international drone tactics proves otherwise. And yet, because they are not combat troops, drone pilots rarely had the same recovery periods or mental-health screenings other troops must complete, reflecting a troubling U.S. drone policy.",
