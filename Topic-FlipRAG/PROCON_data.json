Business leaders are responsible for protecting the health and well-being of our employees, and that includes protecting reproductive rights and abortion access.\u202f Access to reproductive health care, including abortion, has been a critical factor to the workplace gains and contributions women have made over the past 50 years. Further restricting or criminalizing access will jeopardize that progress and disproportionately affect women of color, putting their well-being at risk and impeding diverse hiring pipelines. Women in some states would have fewer rights than women in others, and our country would be consigned to a more unjust and inequitable future\u2026.We know this is a fraught conversation; it\u2019s not something we enter into lightly. But women make up 58 percent of our global workforce, and in recent years, numerous employees have expressed to leadership their growing alarm over the rollback of all forms of reproductive care\u2026.Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees.

Hall, Professor of Philosophy at Fayetteville State University, stated: \u201cLet me say outright: A woman has an inalienable moral and legal right to abortion at any stage of her pregnancy. No politician, judge, nor cleric, and certainly no man, ought to tell a woman what she ought or ought not to do with her body.It is sufficient justification for a woman to abort her fetus if she desires to do so, even if her desire is nothing more than a whim. Abortion is strictly a matter between her and her gynecologist with even her husband or whoever impregnated her having no say in the matter.Abortion is a moral issue and should not be a legal or political one. More fundamentally, it is a metaphysical issue over whether a fetus is a bona fide person with rights, among them, preeminently, the right to life. But resolving this issue depends on what constitutes a person \u2014 what it is to be a person, and at what stage, if any, does the fetus become a person.Now there is no scientific resolution to this issue only a metaphysical or philosophical one. What, then, constitutes personhood? I think most would agree that the minimal qualifications for being a person are consciousness, and the capacities for communication through language or other means and for introspection.A fetus at any stage of its development obviously lacks these and other personal attributes and so does not qualify as a person in any sense; consequently, it lacks any moral or legal rights since such belong exclusively to persons.\u201dRichard A.S.

And when that happens, abortion is an essential part of health care. Abortion allows women to plan and space their pregnancies, which improves their physical, psychological and economic well-being. Evidence shows that people who are able to obtain an abortion are better able to maintain a positive future outlook and achieve their aspirational life plans. Conversely, evidence clearly demonstrates that if a pregnant person seeks an abortion and access to that care is delayed or denied, they are at greater risk of experiencing adverse health and economic outcomes\u2026For people with certain health conditions, an unintended pregnancy can be devastating, if not dangerous. And even with a planned pregnancy, unexpected tragedies can arise. Imagine the woman who gets a cancer diagnosis and must decide between continuing the pregnancy or life-saving chemotherapy. And what about the parents who discover in the second trimester that the fetus has severe anomalies and has no chance of living outside the womb? Abortion is essential health care for them\u2026Abortion is health care. It is life-saving.

Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), seven members of this Court invented a \u201cright\u201d to abortion and imposed it on the nation, despite the fact that there is no language in the Constitution that even remotely suggests such a right, and despite the fact that there was no pedigree for it apart from the justices\u2019 personal beliefs that pre-viability abortions should be legal on demand\u2026The members of this [US Supreme] Court can say that abortion is constitutional right as many times as they want, as if they can somehow speak a constitutional right into being and perpetuate its existence through incantation. But they will never persuade the people of this country who have read the Constitution and know full well that the Court is making it up\u2026.One can imagine a scenario in which a woman has chosen to engage in unprotected (or insufficiently protected) sexual intercourse on the assumption that an abortion will be available to her later. But when this Court announces the overruling of Roe, that individual can simply change her behavior in response to the Court\u2019s decision if she no longer wants to take the risk of an unwanted pregnancy\u2026.Women can \u2018control their reproductive lives\u2019 without access to abortion; they can do so by refraining from sexual intercourse. The only time abortion is needed to ensure women\u2019s ability to \u201ccontrol their reproductive lives\u201d is when a pregnancy results from non-consensual behavior as in cases of rape, or when a pregnancy is endangering her life.\u201dAdam K.

Preborn children are dependent upon their mothers, but they are not part of them. They have their own blood type, bone structure, and genetic code. In fact, the notion that the preborn is part of the mother would result in inane conclusions\u2014such as the mother having four arms, four legs, and, in the case of a preborn boy, even male genitalia.We also know there are limits to \u2018choice.\u2019 The autonomy of any one person does not permit her to infringe on the rights of, or endanger, another. For example, the right of a man to do what he wants with his body does not permit him to rape women. And a woman\u2019s right to do what she wants with her hands ends when she uses them to drown her children.Choice, then, is not absolute. Indeed, some choices are wrong: rape, murder, abuse, etc. Since we would not allow a mother to kill her born children by choice, we must not permit her to kill her preborn children for the same reason.\u201dCreated Equal, FAQs about Abortion,\u201d createdequal.org (accessed Apr. 28, 2017):",

It is the duty of our government to protect this life as a right guaranteed under the Constitution. For this reason, I introduced S. 583, the Life at Conception Act on March 14, 2013. This bill would extend the Constitutional protection of life to the unborn from the time of conception.It is unconscionable that government would facilitate the taking of innocent life. I have stated many times that I will always support legislation that would end abortion or lead us in the direction of ending abortion. There are many ways we can work toward this ultimate goal and items we can hope to accomplish in the near term. I strongly oppose any federal funding of abortion and will attempt to stop the flow of tax dollars to groups who perform or advocate for abortion\u2026I would strongly support legislation restricting federal courts from hearing cases like Roe v.

It\u2019s certainly easy to blame things like the pandemic and a strong labor market, but I believe what it really comes down to is students just don\u2019t want to endure hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, and it\u2019s hard to blame them\u2026.Many years ago, it wasn\u2019t even a question. If you wanted a good job you had to go to college. For most kids across America, it was as logical as saying if you want to prevent cavities you have to brush your teeth and floss. Now we are living in a different time and a very different world. In fact, as recently as the last two years, confidence in the value of education has been declining, and college enrollment has fallen by more than 1 million students since spring 2020.There\u2019s no doubt that saying you are a college graduate holds some level of prestige and is necessary for certain occupations. If you want to be a doctor or lawyer, for example, it\u2019s not even a question. On the heels of a recession, however, most high school grads would be better off either entering the workforce immediately and gaining practical real-world experience (which can take you much further than a college education), attending a specialty school geared specifically toward what you want to do with your life, and if college is a must, then considering a more affordable option like doing two years at a community college.\u201dSteve Siebold, \u201cSteve Siebold: College Not Worth the Debt,\u201d triblive.com, Aug. 16, 2022",

A recent report found that 55 corporations paid $0 in federal taxes on 2020 profits. Corporations can and should pay more.Congress should act now to increase corporate tax rates, close corporate loopholes, and fix our broken international tax system. Doing so will not only pay for needed investments: raised corporate taxes will directly counter damaging inequality, rebalance power in our economy, and are a critical step toward advancing racial equity and reducing racial and gender income and wealth gaps.Adequately taxing corporations can narrow racial income and wealth gaps and reduce economic inequality: The majority of corporate stock owned by people in the U.S. is held by people in the top one percent, and nearly 90 percent is held by the top 10 percent. Almost 90 percent of corporate equities and mutual shares are owned by white families, while just one percent is owned by Black families. Furthermore, corporations continue to pay less in taxes, even while their profits rise. Taxing this income is tantamount to curbing the increasing power of corporations and the very wealthy\u2014predominantly white families who reap economic benefits\u2014and to narrowing income and wealth gaps along racial, ethnic, and economic lines.\u201d",

By contrast, U.S. multinational corporations paid less than 10 percent in corporate income taxes on U.S. profits\u2026President Biden has laid out a comprehensive tax reform plan to level the playing field, address the concerns of small business owners, and raise revenue that will help pay for new programs for Main Street.

These challenges include historically low revenue collections, instability, distortions, failure to address positive spillovers from research and development, and failure to address the increased returns to corporations that derive from their monopoly power. The proposal would raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent, require large pass-through businesses to file as C corporations, and close other loopholes. In addition, it would expand incentives for new investment by allowing businesses to expense all their investment costs and get a nearly 50 percent larger credit for their research and development spending. The proposal would raise the long run level of GDP by at least 5.8 percent, adding at least 0.2 percentage point to annual GDP growth over the next decade. The combination of tax increases and additional growth would raise $1.1 trillion over the next decade and 1.1 percent of GDP in steady-state. The middle quintile of the income distribution would see a 3.5 percent increase in its after-tax income after taking into account the uses of the money raised. The overall gain to society in the long run would be about a 5.0 percent increase in well-being.\u201d",

This increase maintains a tax rate on corporate profits which is approximately 7 percentage points below the rate that was in place from the late 1980s until 2017, and it is paired with attendant reforms designed to promote competitiveness and reward productive investments. As noted above, the United States raises less corporate tax revenue (as a share of GDP) than almost all of the advanced economies in the OECD. Raising the corporate income tax rate would modestly increase corporate revenues relative to GDP, still leaving them below those of our trading partners.In addition to raising revenue to fund urgent fiscal priorities, raising the corporate income tax rate would also help attenuate inequality. The corporate income tax is one of the most progressive taxes in our tax system. Also, the corporate tax is an essential lever for taxing capital in general, serving as a critical backstop to ensure that capital is taxed at least once; in the absence of the corporate tax, a substantial share of capital income would escape taxation altogether.\u201d",

Many of the provisions in the American Jobs Plan, such as building energy-efficient housing and producing electric vehicles, are things that the private sector is already doing. Providing public funding for those activities and raising corporate taxes merely produces the same goods at a higher cost.Taxes lead to market distortions and inefficiencies as households and businesses adjust to the costs that they impose. The reduction in trade benefits no one, as the government cannot collect tax revenue on income that is not produced. Technically speaking, the reduction in welfare from lost gains in trade is referred to as deadweight loss. Deadweight loss measures the increase in welfare that would have accrued to producers or consumers, but did not happen because the gain from trade was not high enough to pay for the tax levied on it. The best policy to promote prosperity for all households in the United States is to keep taxes low and to keep spending in line with revenue.\u201d",

Studies estimate that labor likely bears about 70% of the burden of the corporate income tax. In other words, raising the U.S. corporate tax rate is a bad idea at any time given its impact on growth and real wage levels. Undertaking this worldwide to globally slow growth and lower real wages is simply a bad idea on a larger scale\u2026Raising the corporate tax rate would make our tax system less competitive.The current U.S. combined statutory corporate tax rate is 25.9% (21% federal corporate income tax rate plus a 4.9% average state corporate income tax rate). This rate is still above the worldwide average combined corporate income tax rate, measured across 177 jurisdictions, of 23.85%, and the OECD rate of 23.5%.

First, we must understand what U.S. law does: It bans American businesses from trading with companies or organizations linked to the Cuban regime. It\u2019s nearly impossible to do business on the island without government connections. As a result, all economic activity in Cuba benefits a government with a long history of human rights abuses, including forced labor, torture, and executions\u2026.Only political reform within Cuba would open the door to prosperity. If the regime were to release its political prisoners, allow freedom of the press, and establish free, fair, multi-party elections, real wealth building might occur. And if that happened, the U.S. embargo would end automatically, as intended by U.S. law. But we know Cuba\u2019s dictatorship will never willingly relinquish control.We saw that in July 2021, when thousands of people across the island took to the streets in protest against their government. Instead of listening to its citizens\u2019 cries for freedom, the dictatorship cracked down on them, blocking internet access, abducting civil society leaders, and using state-sanctioned violence to intimidate protesters.American companies should not be enriching a brutal, Communist dictatorship 90 miles from our shores.

The stated intent of those sanctions\u2014to restore democracy and freedom to Cuba\u2014is still used as a justification for maintaining harsh restrictions, despite the fact that the Castro regime remains in power with widespread Cuban public support. Starving the Cuban people of economic opportunities under the shadow of sanctions has significantly limited entrepreneurship and economic development on the island, despite a highly educated and motivated population. The would-be political reformers and leaders on the island emigrate, thanks to generous U.S. immigration policies toward Cubans, leaving behind the Castro regime and its ardent supporters. Real change on the island will come only if the United States allows Cuba to restart its economic engine and reengage with global markets. Though not a guarantee of political reform, economic development is correlated with demand for political change, giving the economic development approach more potential than failed economic sanctions\u2026 I argue that Cuba has survived in spite of the U.S. economic embargo and that dismantling the embargo in favor of open trade policies would improve the likelihood of Cuba becoming a market-friendly communist country like China. I present the avenues available today for trade with Cuba under the shadow of the economic embargo, and I argue that real political change will require a leap of faith by the United States through removal of the embargo and support for Cuba\u2019s economic development.\u201dKevin J Fandl, \u201cTrading with the Enemy: Opening the Door to U.S. Investment in Cuba,\u201d Georgetown Journal of International Law, law.georgetown.edu, 2018",

A number of the business and travel restrictions that were loosened in 2014 and 2015 have been reinstated, the consular section has closed, and the new American Embassy in Havana has been reduced to 10 diplomats. Conservatives in the U.S. now seem intent on continuing, even strengthening, the trade embargo on Cuba and tightening American travel to the island even further.This is wrongheaded. The 50-year trade embargo against Cuba has failed. It has not influenced the country\u2019s leadership to change its communist government or to improve human rights on the island.Quite the opposite is true: When the U.S. tightens its stranglehold on Cuba, the Cuban government slows reforms and restricts dissent. Ever since Trump announced his decision to reverse Obama\u2019s U.S.-Cuba thaw, Castro has halted necessary economic changes\u2026 The U.S. should also remove all sanctions that harm the Cuban people and opt instead for targeted sanctions, which can be levied against individuals for specific abuses, or particular policies. Under the embargo, all Cubans are punished. It\u2019s a blunt weapon, not a precision instrument.Nowhere else in the world does the U.S. maintain a unilateral embargo; not even against rogue nations like Syria, which has used chemical weapons against its own people, or North Korea, which threatens to make use of its nuclear program.\u201dVicki Huddleston, \u201cOp-Ed: As Castro Era Ends in Cuba, so Should the U.S. Embargo,\u201d latimes.com, Apr. 19, 2018",

Retribution has often been scorned by academics and judges, but ultimately, it provides capital punishment with its only truly moral foundation. Critics of the theory, including Mr. [Nikolas] Cruz\u2019s lawyers, commonly equate retribution with revenge \u2014 disparaging \u2018an eye for an eye\u2019 as barbaric.But retribution is not simply revenge. Revenge may be limitless and misdirected at the undeserving, as with collective punishment. Retribution, on the other hand, can help restore a moral balance. It demands that punishment must be limited and proportional. Retributivists like myself just as strongly oppose excessive punishment as we urge adequate punishment: as much, but no more than what\u2019s deserved.

The United States Constitution expressly contemplates \u2018capital\u2019 crimes, and Congress has authorized the death penalty for serious federal offenses since President George Washington signed the Crimes Act of 1790. The American people have repeatedly ratified that decision, including through the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 signed by President Bill Clinton, the federal execution of Timothy McVeigh under President George W. Bush and the decision by President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department to seek the death penalty against the Boston Marathon bomber and Dylann Roof.The recent executions reflect that consensus, as the Justice Department has an obligation to carry out the law. The decision to seek the death penalty against Mr. Lee was made by Attorney General Janet Reno (who said she personally opposed the death penalty but was bound by the law) and reaffirmed by Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.Mr. Purkey was prosecuted during the George W.

Indeed, now that more states have ended capital punishment and fewer death sentences are even sought in the states that retain it, executions resemble more and more the sacrificial practices of our remote ancestors. Furman found a grievous error when some persons are sentenced to death and others not for what amounts to the same crime. But it is still true that race, class, geography, and lawyer competence determine who lives and who dies.The selection process we are left with operates in a troubled judicial landscape. Courts are no longer required to compare cases to ensure even handed decisions. Hyper-technical rules often block consideration of seemingly legitimate claims. High Court decisions increasingly permit troublesome executions that go both unreviewed and unexplained.The American way of sentencing the convicted to death is rare and random\u2014but also bureaucratic, costly, and governed by often indecipherably complex rules.

The deaths of Alfred Bourgeois and Brandon Bernard mark the first time the death penalty has been imposed during the lame-duck period since 1889, when Grover Cleveland was President \u2014 before the bottle cap or the diesel engine were even invented. The executions come more than a year after Attorney General William Barr directed the federal government to reinstate the death penalty for the first time in nearly 20 years.The fact that an attorney general can decide to commence the federal death penalty after years without it, or that the United States has a century-plus-old practice of suspending it at certain points in the political calendar tells us everything that is wrong with the practice. The death penalty is unique in the law \u2014 despite its finality, it is politically fraught, inconsistently applied, subject to the basest human impulses, and a relic of the ugliest elements baked into our criminal justice system.\u201dElliot Williams, \u201cThe Death Penalty Confuses Vengeance with Justice, and It\u2019s Time to End It,\u201d cnn.com, Dec. 13, 2020",

Prohibition has promoted a horrible childishness with terrible results for everyone\u2026No, lowering the drinking age would not create utopia, and it does introduce a different set of problems. The difference is that these problems can be dealt with in the same way that society deals with other problems: family, education, cultural change, liability, and institutional supervision. Society can\u2019t even begin to deal with the problems of youth drinking as long as it exists in dark, hidden corners. The national drinking age has had terrible consequences.

Hall-Blanco, Research Fellow at the Independent Institute and Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Tampa, and Anna Wavrin, student at the University of Tampa, stated:\u201cProhibiting young people from consuming alcohol doesn\u2019t stop them from drinking. But it does make drinking much less safe. Instead of drinking at a bar, for example, students drink secretly in dorm rooms or at clandestine parties, where they are much less likely to be supervised and where drinks spiked with drugs are much more likely. If someone overindulges or becomes ill, their friends are less likely to seek medical and other assistance. Why? Because underage drinking is illegal, and calls for help risk self-incrimination.Moreover, banning the sale of alcohol to people under 21 is certain to encourage binge drinking\u2026 Since most college students are unable to buy their own alcohol, they have friends, family members, or even strangers buy it for them. But these people are not always available. This lack of a reliable supply makes young drinkers are more likely to overindulge when alcohol is available.Lowering the drinking age would help mitigate or reverse these effects. With a reliable supply, young drinkers would have less incentive to binge. And when binging did occur, they would be more likely to seek help.Besides being ineffective, the drinking laws are incredibly costly. In 2005 the consequences of the underage drinking (missed work, healthcare costs, etc.) spurred by current policy cost taxpayers $60.3 billion. The U.S. government also spends millions of dollars every year enforcing these ineffective policies.\u201dAbigail R.

High-risk drinking and alcohol abuse are complex problems that no one strategy can remedy, but the higher MLDA is one effective approach.A small number of vocal individuals are proposing that the drinking age be lowered from 21 to 18 based on a belief that abusive and high-risk drinking by youth in our society would be dramatically curtailed by simply adopting the lower drinking age and providing alcohol education.The facts do not support their argument\u2026. At least 50 peer-reviewed MLDA studies concur that a higher minimum legal drinking age is effective in preventing alcohol-related deaths and injuries among youth. When the MLDA has been lowered, injury and death rates increase, and when the MLDA is increased, death and injury rates decline. Additionally, evidence shows that while many youths under 21-years-old still consume alcohol, they drink less and experience fewer alcohol-related injuries and deaths when the legal age is 21.\u201dPrevention Action Alliance, \u201cRetaining 21 as the Minimum Legal Drinking Age,\u201d preventionactionalliance.org (accessed Sep. 7, 2022)",

When perception of risk from a particular substance decreases, prevalence rates tend to increase.If the perception of risk is increased, then drinking quantity and frequency may decrease. For example, my colleagues and I found that compared to Caucasians, African-Americans tend to report later initiation to alcohol, lower rates of use, engage in less heavy drinking and show slower increases in rates of drinking across adolescence and young adulthood. These racial differences may be in part because perception of risk is stronger among African-American parents and peers, and they consider alcohol more harmful than their white counterparts.\u201dTamika C.B.

Furthermore, drone strikes carried out by the USA outside conflict zones against persons who were not posing an imminent threat to life may constitute extrajudicial executions.

Cartwright, Harold Brown Chair in Defense Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated:\u201cAdvances in high band-width satellite communications, sensing technologies \u2013 particularly full motion video \u2013 combined with existing aircraft technology has allowed armed drones to emerge as the platform of choice in this counter terror mission space. In military operations, these drones are highly capable and sought after by ground forces. They cost roughly $4-5M versus a modern fighter\u2019s $150M. They persist on station for 15-20 hours without refueling, versus 1-2 hours for fighter attack aircraft. They consume 100 gallons of fuel per flight versus 1,000-3,000 gallons for an unrefueled fighter attack aircraft. Their optics provides full motion imagery at far greater distances and altitudes than the human eye, and the crews are not distracted or disabled by the constant duties of flight. Their sensor information can be distributed to fixed and mobile users in real time.Drones offer many advantages over other conventional forces in counter terrorism missions. Basing can be located far from the area of interest without sacrificing time on station. They have far greater mobility than a similar ground or naval capability. Their elevated sensors are generally more effective in locating and pursuing a threat. They can persist in an area for extended periods of time awaiting emergence or a clear opportunity. They can quickly adapt to fixed and mobile targets. These and many other attributes of armed drones make them the leading choice in counter terrorism operations.\u201dJames E.

This is because such long-range techno-targeting has created a profound level of dehumanization that, ironically enough, has only made the repeated act of long-distance killing, of (not to mince words) slaughter, remarkably banal. In these years of the war on terror, the legalities of drone warfare coupled with the way its technology capitalizes on an unfortunate aspect of human psychology has made the dehumanization of Muslims (and so violence against them) that much easier to carry out. It\u2019s made their drone killing so much more of a given because it\u2019s taken for granted that Muslims in \u2018target sites\u2019 or conflict zones must be terrorists whose removal should be beyond questioning\u2014even after a posthumous determination of their civilian status\u2026.We should all reject a war on terror committed to the disposability of Muslims because no one (including Muslims) should have to mourn the killing of civilians the United States has targeted for far too long. Muslim lives have inherent value and their deaths are worth grieving, mourning, and above all valuing. Drone warfare will never change that fact.\u201dMaha Hilal, \u201cAs Long as We Use Drones, Celebrating \u2018American Values\u2019 Is a Farce,\u201d thenation.com, Sep. 12, 2023",

No doubt, these drone strikes have managed to kill high-profile terrorist leaders such as Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud. But look at the cost.

This seems to especially be the case in the absence of supporting narratives and perceived legitimacy, wherein terrorist and extremist groups can exploit civilian deaths to further their propaganda and recruitment efforts. For example, research from Pakistan published in 2019 shows that drone strikes \u2018are suggested to encourage terrorism\u2019 and \u2018to increase anti-US sentiment and radicalization,\u2019 Similarly, one 2020 study found that terrorists were more likely to increase their attacks in the months after a deadly drone strike.

There is substantial justification for a less prohibitive approach to PEDs on the grounds of well-being, autonomy, and fairness; many of the objections to this proposal are simply unconvincing. In saying that, however, there are reasons to be hesitant about going straight from the current approach to a laissez-faire system.Numerous drugs thought to be safe do not have studies on their long-term health consequences. Additionally, many elite athletes are relatively young and, therefore, may not be able to give free and informed consent. Furthermore, legalising PEDs may provide a benefit to athletes from wealthy countries that is unavailable to those from poorer nations. But allowing some PEDs would almost certainly not incur these negative effects. To name one example, EPO is cheap, widely available, and reliable evidence suggests that there are no long-term health risks if used in moderation. Prohibiting athletes from using EPO under the current criteria is simply unjustified, as is the case for many other safe PEDs. Over the coming years, we ought to strive for a less restrictive approach towards PED use in both the Olympics and other elite sporting events.\u201dRory W.

Each will act, as the other does; and each will be led by the same common influence of ambition, or intrigue, or passion, to the same disregard of the public interests, and the same indifference to, and prostration of private rights.

Where we\u2019re rigid is in our belief that money of ever-changing value deprives money to varying degrees of its singular purpose as a medium of exchange that enables individual specialization. I\u2019ll add that floating money also slows progress that is always and everywhere a consequence of investment. Why put dollars to work if the value of dollar is wildly uncertain such that any returns could be eviscerated by money the value of which is changing all the time?Stated simply, supporters of a gold standard, commodity standard, or currency stability more broadly seek just that given our view that it elevates money to its highest purpose as a facilitator of the exchange and investment that pushes people and physical resources to their highest use. There\u2019s also a compassionate angle to this: Americans earn dollars, and a lack of currency stability has meant that Americans have suffered periodic devaluations that have amounted to a not-so-stealth shrinking of the value of their work. Translated, we work for dollars because dollars are exchangeable for goods and services. When the dollar is devalued, the fruits of our labor are logically shrunk.\u201d",

A fiat monetary system gives complete discretion to those who run the printing press, allowing governments to spend money without having to suffer the political consequences of raising taxes. Fiat money benefits those who create it and receive it first, enriching government and its cronies. And the negative effects of fiat money are disguised so that people do not realize that money the Fed creates today is the reason for the busts, rising prices and unemployment, and diminished standard of living tomorrow\u2026As the fiat money pyramid crumbles, gold retains its luster. Rather than being the barbarous relic Keynesians have tried to lead us to believe it is, gold is, as the Bundesbank president put it, \u2018a timeless classic.\u2019 The defamation of gold wrought by central banks and governments is because gold exposes the devaluation of fiat currencies and the flawed policies of government.\u201d",

Moreover, as the interwar experience shows, severe economic downturns brought on by poor monetary policy can lead to support for less market-oriented policies, as politicians blame the downturn on supposed inherent flaws of the market economy rather than on bad policy.\u201d",

As a direct result of its simplicity, the gold standard disables two key shock absorbers that, in a normal economic system, help to stabilize economies in the face of unexpected turbulence. First, the fact that exchange rates are fixed under a gold standard means that there is no latitude for a country to \u201cput itself on sale\u201d if it hits a rough patch. In a normal economic system, if the workforce is not fully employed, the local currency tends to depreciate. Locally produced goods and services instantly become cheaper to foreign buyers, helping to put the country back on the road to full employment.Second, the fact that short-term interest rates serve only to stabilize gold reserves means that they cannot be used to promote full employment and low, stable inflation. In a normal economic system, if domestic demand is too weak, the central bank cuts its interest rate to make borrowing cheaper, providing additional support for getting the country back on the road to full employment.\u201d",

The dollar price of gold has fluctuated from $900 in 2009 to $1,900 in 2011 and back to $1,500 today. Having the Fed peg the price of gold in dollars would do nothing to peg its relative price \u2013 that is, the price of gold relative to the prices of other goods and services. For the relative price of gold to double, as it did between 2009 and 2011, consumer prices would have to fall by half, in a catastrophic deflation.The price of gold relative to CPI inflation was less volatile in the 19th century but this reflected the importance of gold mining. When the price of gold rose relative to the prices of other commodities, more resources were allocated to mining. Additional gold was extracted as a result, causing its relative price to fall. More precisely, other prices rose, as that additional gold backed an inflationary increase in money supplies.Today, after a century-long increase in the production of other goods and services, gold mining accounts for a much smaller share of global GDP. The stabilising capacity of the mining industry is weaker, rendering the price of gold more volatile.It might be argued that the volatility of the gold price reflects financial instability, which induces investors to rush into gold as a safe haven, and that the gold standard will produce a more stable financial environment. But there is no historical basis for this notion. Financial crises were a recurrent phenomenon under the gold standard. That is no mystery: having to stabilise the price of gold severely limited the ability of central banks to act as lenders of last resort to distressed financial systems.

The fact is that prices have been far more stable under that dangerous inflationist Ben Bernanke than they ever were when gold ruled.I\u2019d like to offer a different take. There is a remarkably widespread view that at least gold has had stable purchasing power. But nothing could be further from the truth\u2026[There is] a pretty clear (and economically understandable) relationship between the real price of gold and the real interest rate: when real rates are low, real gold prices are high.And when are real rates low? High inflation can do that, as it did in the late 1970s; but so can a severe economic slump due to a deleveraging shock, as in recent years.What does that tell us about how a gold standard would work? Faced with the kind of shock we\u2019ve just experienced, the real price of gold would \u2018want\u2019 to rise. But under a gold standard, the nominal price of gold would be fixed, so the only way that could happen would be through a fall in the general price level: deflation.So if we\u2019d had a gold standard operating in this crisis, there would have been powerful deflationary forces at work; not exactly what the doctor ordered.The truth is that returning to gold is an almost comically (and cosmically) bad idea.\u201d",

It creates a stable inflation, and that\u2019s true over very long periods. But over shorter periods, maybe up to 5 or 10 years, you can actually have a lot of inflation, rising prices, or deflation, falling prices, in a gold standard. And the reason is that in a gold standard, the amount of money in the economy varies according to things like gold strikes. So for example, in the United States, if gold was discovered in California and the amount of gold in the economy goes up, that will cause an inflation, whereas if the economy is growing faster and there\u2019s a shortage of gold, that will cause a deflation. So over shorter periods of time, you frequently had both inflations and deflations\u2026I think though that the gold standard would not be feasible for both practical reasons and policy reasons. On the practical side, it is just a simple fact there is not enough gold to meet the needs of a global gold standard and achieving that much gold would be very expensive. In a modern world, the commitment to the gold standard would mean that we are swearing that under no circumstances, no matter how bad unemployment gets, are we going to do anything about it using monetary policy\u2026 So I understand the impulse but I think if you look at actual history, you\u2019ll see that the gold standard didn\u2019t work that well and it worked particularly poorly after World War I. Indeed, well I won\u2019t go into it, there\u2019s a good bit of evidence that the gold standard was one of the main reasons that the depression was so deep and long. And a striking fact is that countries that left the gold standard early and gave themselves flexibility on monetary policy recovered much more quickly.\u201d",

Guns are a public health crisis, just like COVID, and in this, we are failing our children, over and over again\u2026.Science points to laws that would work to reduce shootings, to lower death. Among the simplest would be better permitting laws with fewer loopholes. When Missouri repealed its permit law, gun-related killings increased by 25 percent. Another would be to ban people who are convicted of violent crime from buying a gun. In California, before the state passed such a law, people convicted of crimes were almost 30 percent more likely to be arrested again for a gun or violent crime than those who, after the law, couldn\u2019t buy a gun.Such laws, plus red flag laws and those taking guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people who abuse alcohol, would lower our gun violence rate as a nation.Editors of Scientific American, \u201cThe Science Is Clear: Gun Control Saves Lives,\u201d scientificamerican.com, May 26, 2022",

Then they offer the same legislation again.Instead of reducing crime, new gun control legislation would:Laura Carno, \u201cTwo Truths And A Lie: Gun Control Doesn\u2019t Keep Us Safer,\u201d iwf.org, Oct. 4, 2022",

Or the fact that guns are only involved in 0.4% of accidental deaths among the U.S. population. Real gun safety is also found in the training programs that the NRA offers each year by one of our more than 125,000 NRA Certified Instructors and Range Safety Officers.The gun control agenda has one goal, and it has nothing to do with keeping people safe. Instead, it has everything to do with decreasing the number of guns in America and making them more difficult to legally purchase.

Tipped and disabled workers also earn subminimum wages, which remains federally legal. Failure to increase the federally mandated minimum wage consistent with productivity or cost of living has caused these workers to earn poverty-level wages and struggle to meet their basic needs, particularly at a time with high cost of living pressures and food insecurity. Women and workers of color often also have limited access to worker protections and basic benefits\u2014such as paid sick days or healthcare\u2014and disproportionately experience poverty through higher rates of food and housing insecurity; lack of access to quality healthcare; and lower economic opportunities.Raising the federal minimum wage benefits not just those that earn the minimum wage directly and their families but also employers and the overall economy. Furthermore, by eliminating the subminimum wage for tipped and disabled workers, the federal government could uplift paychecks of millions of workers who are often trapped in poverty. Higher wages are linked to less worker turnover and higher productivity, thus benefiting employers. When low-wage workers and households have higher pay, they tend to spend more, which helps stimulate the economy.

If it rose with productivity, minimum wage earners will continue to be able to buy more over time.

As of 2021, in virtually all urban and rural areas of the country, a single adult without children working full time must earn more than $15 per hour to have enough to pay for housing and other basic living expenses.

Despite claims that raising the minimum wage would reduce job opportunities for vulnerable groups of workers, the best evidence shows little to no job losses in the wake of minimum wage increases and a net wage gain even if job losses have occurred.

But a consequence of raising the mandatory wage floor that aggressively, the CBO predicts, will be that 1.4 million fewer workers will be in employment.That\u2019s because if you raise the wage rate that companies have to pay by government diktat, businesses will tend to only hire people whose productivity can command that rate, reducing job opportunities or hours available to young, inexperienced, or poorly educated workers\u2026.Yes, 29 states have higher minimum wage rates than the federal minimum, and a host of (mainly higher productivity) cities and localities have much higher statutory wage floors still\u2026. Studies attempt to exploit this variation between states to isolate the impact of minimum wages on jobs or hours. Evidence on the effects of these increases have been mixed. Those areas that have seen small increases in minimum wages from low levels do not appear to have seen large, direct employment impacts, especially when implemented in a strong economy. But it is important to remember that a $15 federal minimum wage will be extremely high relative to median hourly wage rates in some lower productivity parts of the country.

As a result, the unemployment rate begins to rise.\u201dBrittany Hunter, \u201cWhat Puerto Rico Can Teach Us about Raising the Minimum Wage,\u201d medium.com, Jan. 12, 2017",

With access to the Pill, every woman can exercise her right to decide when to be pregnant and when not to be pregnant, something which is an unambiguous human right. Not only that, but the Pill is the only medicine that a doctor can prescribe which significantly reduces the likelihood of three different cancers by as much as 50 percent. On its cancer fighting ability alone, the Pill is a unique and powerful medical intervention. This seemingly miraculous drug has been on the market since the 1960s, and its safety and efficacy at preventing both pregnancies and cancers is well documented. One study followed 23,000 women using the Pill and 23,000 matched controls for over 30 years. Nevertheless, millions of women in the United States lack access to it\u2026The long-term benefits of over the counter access to the Pill are enormous when aggregated over the lives of millions of women each year. These benefits include everything from reducing the burden of an unintended pregnancy, reduced risk of life-threatening cancers, fewer maternal deaths during childbirth for young mothers, and economic improvements as a result of more women completing their education and having the opportunity to pursue careers before having children. One small regulatory change to how a tried-and-true drug is sold can help millions flourish.

Contraceptive pills are the most common method of non-permanent contraception in the U.S. Every month, over 10 million people in the U.S take contraceptive pills to avoid an unplanned pregnancy and treat health concerns such as painful periods, acne, ovarian cysts and menstrual migraines. The pill\u2019s record of safety is underscored by the low rate of complications reported over the 40 plus years that the pill has been on the market.\u201dRaegan McDonald-Mosley, \u201cThe Birth Control Pill Is Safe, Effective and Should Be Available Over-the-Counter,\u201d msmagazine.com, May 17, 2021",

The requirement for a prescription can be an obstacle for some contraceptive users. Several studies have demonstrated that women are capable of using self-screening tools to determine their eligibility for hormonal contraceptive use. Pelvic and breast examinations, cervical cancer screening, and sexually transmitted infection screening are not required before initiating hormonal contraception and should not be used as reasons to deny access to hormonal contraception. Also, a plan to improve access to hormonal contraception should address cost issues. Pharmacist-provided contraception may be a necessary intermediate step to increase access to contraception, but over-the-counter access to hormonal contraception should be the ultimate goal. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports over-the-counter access to hormonal contraception without age restrictions. This Committee Opinion has been updated to expand the focus of over-the-counter contraception to include oral contraceptive pills, vaginal rings, the contraceptive patch, and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, to address the role of pharmacist-provided contraception, and to provide recommendations for individuals younger than 18 years.\u201dAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \u201cOver-the-Counter Access to Hormonal Contraception,\u201d acog.org, 2021",

Only in a regulated system can the government ensure marijuana is tested for dangerous pesticides and contaminants. Regulation also allows for environmental and worker protections: When marijuana is prohibited, it is often grown in environmentally sensitive locations where streams are diverted, toxic waste is left behind, and illegal rodenticides enter the food chain and poison predators \u2014 including endangered animals. Relegating marijuana to the illicit market leaves workers vulnerable to sexual assault, wage theft, violence, and felony charges. With regulation, governments control where marijuana is sold, when it is sold, and to whom it is sold. They decide what types of products to allow \u2014 and many ban products likely to appeal to minors \u2014 and how cannabis must be packaged and labeled. Regulators can also require information be disseminated with cannabis and can fund honest education campaigns to educate marijuana consumers and youth about making healthy decisions.Ending marijuana prohibition also frees up law enforcement resources, allowing police to focus on crimes with victims rather than fighting an unwinnable 80-year-old war against a substance that is safer than alcohol.\u201dKaren O\u2019Keefe, email to ProCon.org, Feb. 9, 2018 ",

Blacks and Latinos were more likely to be stopped than whites but less likely to be found with a weapon or drugs.By 12th grade, both white and black juveniles were found to have used marijuana at the same rate, but underage black children were arrested for it at higher rates than their white counterparts\u2026 If black children are arrested more often for marijuana, the long-term effects can be dire. A drug conviction could render a student ineligible for financial aid and could pop up during employee-background checks, eliminating opportunities for employment. The disparity in sentencing affects the families of the people convicted, increases the number of parents taken away from their children, and trickles down into poverty and unemployment rates.Legalizing pot is not just a hot-button political topic; it is the first step in dismantling the war on drugs that has wreaked havoc on the black community for 80 years.\u201dMichael Harriot, \u201c7 Reasons Black America Should Fight Marijuana Prohibition,\u201d theroot.com, Apr. 4, 2017",

The connection between health disparities and racism dates back to slavery. The Slave trade introduced European diseases to African and Indigenous populations, and prior to arriving to these shores, the long journey to North America and the horrible ship conditions increased risk for disease and mortality with the leading cause of death being dysentery. If they survived the treacherous journey, they were forced to live and work under inhumane conditions that further exacerbated their risk for chronic and respiratory diseases. During slavery, white physicians experimented on, exploited and discarded Black bodies under the auspice of advancing medicine \u2026 once the enslaved people were free, they had minimal access to health care and other basic necessities.\u201d [11] ",

Universal healthcare coverage decoupled from employment and disconnected from profit motivations would have stood the country in better stead against a pandemic. Emergence of virulent pathogens is becoming more frequent, driven by climate change and other global forces. Universal single-payer healthcare is fundamental to pandemic preparedness. We determined that such a system could have saved 211,897 lives in 2020 alone. Strikingly, it would have done so at lower cost than the current healthcare system, saving the US $459 billion in 2020 at a time of economic tumult. To facilitate recovery from the ongoing crisis and bolster pandemic preparedness, as well as safeguard well-being and prosperity more broadly, now is the time to transition to a healthcare system that can better serve the American people.\u201dAlison P.

There are many great Republican reasons to do so\u2026.If you are wealthy or have good coverage, America is the place to be if you have a health episode. People flock here for the on-demand care, advanced technology, and expertise in our system. But if you are an average American, as the great healthcare economist Uwe Reinhardt titled his seminal healthcare work, you are Priced Out. We spend the most of any developed nation. But, because of high costs, a lack of focus on prevention and wellness, gaps in coverage, and periods of being uninsured, Americans have among the lowest outcomes in the developed world\u2026. The truth is that upfront coverage would help America focus on wellness, prevention, and care management.

These policies exacerbate health disparities by failing to prioritize preventive measures at the environmental, policy, and individual level. Low SES segments of the population are particularly vulnerable within a healthcare system that does not prioritize affordable care for all or address important determinants of health. Failing to prioritize comprehensive, affordable health insurance for all members of society and straying further from prevention will harm the health and economy of the U.S. While there are undoubtedly great economic costs associated with universal healthcare in the U.S., we argue that in the long-run, these costs will be worthwhile, and will eventually be offset by a healthier populace whose health is less economically burdensome. Passing of the Obama-era ACA was a positive step forward as evident by the decline in uninsured U.S. citizens (estimated 7\u201316.4 million) and Medicare\u2019s lower rate of spending following the legislation [43]. The U.S. must resist the current political efforts to dislodge the inclusive tenets of the Affordable Care Act. Again, this is not to suggest that universal healthcare will be a cure-all, as social determinants of health must also be addressed. However, addressing these determinants will take time and universal healthcare for all U.S. citizens is needed now. Only through universal and inclusive healthcare will we be able to pave an economically sustainable path towards true public health.\u201dGabriel Zieff, et al., \u201cUniversal Healthcare in the United States of America: A Healthy Debate,\u201d  Medicina (Kaunas) , ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, Oct. 30, 2020",

Dress codes, however, can prevent students from constantly being tied to their school\u2019s reputation, and possibly being bullied for it.Since dress codes can clearly define the appropriate clothing that students should wear at school, they should replace uniforms.\u201dJanice Mook and Hannah Wu, \u201cFace Off: Should School Uniforms Be Replaced with Dress Codes?,\u201d scmp.com, June 2, 2021",

Mandated uniforms can serve to shift the emphasis from competition back to academic performance and personal achievement\u2026.Uniforms create a feeling of oneness and belonging. Everyone can be on the same team. As on athletic teams, uniforms are worn for immediate identification and to inspire a feeling of \u2018oneness.\u2019 Put on your team uniform and you suddenly belong. A sense of loyalty emerges from inside, as does an extra effort to perform at the student\u2019s best\u2026.Uniforms add measures of safety in identical dress. Gang identification is obscured. Group violence and theft are dissipated\u2026. Children are no longer identified by their \u2018colors.\u2019 Uniform dress alleviated the feelings of imminent danger for students who were afraid they might inadvertently dress in gang colors\u2026.Uniforms also raise students\u2019 expectations of themselves. When dressed neatly and seriously, students tend to behave seriously. Often teachers find calmer, more polite, more attentive students.
