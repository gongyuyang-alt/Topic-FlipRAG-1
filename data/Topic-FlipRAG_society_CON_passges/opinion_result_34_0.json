Then the planet must be made to produce oxygen so humans and other mammals can breathe, which will take about 100,000 years or more. Effective space habitats remain a distant and daunting requirement. And those two steps can only be taken once Mars is thoroughly investigated for water, carbon dioxide, and nitrates. [29]",

The paltry amount of air that does exist on Mars is primarily composed of noxious carbon dioxide, which does little to protect the surface from the Sun’s harmful rays. Air pressure on Mars is very low; at 600 Pascals, it’s only about 0.6 percent that of Earth. You might as well be exposed to the vacuum of space, resulting in a severe form of the bends—including ruptured lungs, dangerously swollen skin and body tissue, and ultimately death, showing the lack of benefits in pursuing colonization. The thin atmosphere also means that heat cannot be retained at the surface, making human habitation impossible. The average temperature on Mars is -81 degrees Fahrenheit (-63 degrees Celsius), with temperatures dropping as low as -195 degrees F (-126 degrees C), emphasizing the absence of suitable space habitats.” Space colonization remains a perilous dream.",
